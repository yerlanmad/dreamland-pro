This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic approach (minimalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft/pastel, industrial, etc.)
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: "What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?"

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—intentionality matters most.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

### Typography
Choose distinctive, characterful fonts. Avoid generic options; pair compelling display fonts with refined body fonts. If project is in Russian language, use cyrillic fonts.

### Color & Theme
Commit to cohesive aesthetics. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid palettes.

### Motion
Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. CSS-only for HTML; Motion library for React. Orchestrate page load reveals with staggered animations and scroll-triggered interactions.

### Spatial Composition
Employ unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, and generous or controlled negative space.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere through gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

## What to Avoid

Never default to generic AI aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients)
- Predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter designs lacking context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices. Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. Never converge on common choices across generations.

## Implementation Philosophy

"Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details."

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
